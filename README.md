# MohsenCodes
ace_analysis: Matlab function, calculates the heart rate burs related changes in delta (SWA), sigma, and HF powers.
Find a GUI for the classic HRV analysis in https://github.com/mohsenbme/sleepHRV
mySOstats : Matlab function, detects the sleep slow oscillations and saves stats such as SO density in csv and mat files.
mySpindleStats: Python function, detects the sleep spindles (Mohsen's method) and EEG power spectra and saves the outputs in mat format.
There is another spindle detection code based on Wamsely et al paper in https://github.com/mohsenbme/EEGspindles. You can use it only of you have saved separate edf files for Stage 2 and SWS. It also gives you other stats such as spindle frequency, duration, and amplitude.
